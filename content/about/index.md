# About

I'm Kalin Daskalov — a DevOps Engineer focused on Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure, with experience across both startup and enterprise environments. At work, I'm gradually building skills in Go-based operator development and SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity and security. Outside of work, I'm exploring MLOps and AI—particularly how to optimize LLM training and inference on Kubernetes. Most of that exploration is documented here.

Before tech, I came from a very different world — bookbinding and high craft. My hobby was customizing linux distros since I was 15 and ironically it became my career but at scale.
