# About

I'm Kalin Daskalov — a DevOps and Platform Engineer from Sofia, Bulgaria. Focused on scalable infrastructure, Kubernetes, and cloud-native tooling. I currently work at SAP, where I build secure, production-grade systems that support enterprise-scale workloads.

Before tech, I came from a very different world — bookbinding and high craft. That hands-on, detail-oriented mindset still drives how I approach engineering: with patience, precision, and a builder’s mentality.

Through Sonda.red, I share my journey as I go deeper into MLOps, GPU workloads, and system-level experimentation, all powered by my Intel-based homelab. This is where I think in public—documenting the process.
